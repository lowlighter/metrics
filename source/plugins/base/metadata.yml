      Base content

      The following sections are supported:
      - `header`, which usually contains username, two-weeks commits calendars and a few additional data
      - `activity`, which contains recent activity (commits, pull requests, issues, etc.)
      - `community`, which contains community stats (following, sponsors, organizations, etc.)
      - `repositories`, which contains repository stats (license, forks, stars, etc.)
      - `metadata`, which contains information about generated metrics

      These are all enabled by default, but it is possible to explicitly opt out from them.
    type: array
    format: comma-separated
    default: header, activity, community, repositories, metadata
    values:
      - header
      - activity
      - community
      - repositories
      - metadata

      Indepth mode

      Enabling this will consume additional API queries to fetch more data.
      This currently improves the accuracy of the following statistics:
        - total commits
        - total issues
        - total pull requests
        - total pull requests reviews
        - total repositories contributed to
    type: boolean
    default: no
    extras:
      - metrics.api.github.overuse

  base_hireable:

      Show `Available for hire!` in header section
    type: boolean
    default: no

  repositories:
    description: |
      Fetched repositories

      A higher value result in more accurate metrics but can hit GitHub API rate-limit more easily (especially with a lot of plugins enabled)
    type: number
    default: 100
    min: 0

  repositories_batch:
    description: |
      Fetched repositories per query

      If you receive `Something went wrong while executing your query` (which is usually caused by API timeouts), lowering this value may help.
      This setting may not be supported by all plugins.
    type: number
    default: 100
    max: 100
    min: 1

  repositories_forks:

      Include forks
    type: boolean
    default: no

  repositories_affiliations:
    description: |
      Repositories affiliations

      - `owner`: owned repositories
      - `collaborator`: repositories with push access
      - `organization_member`: repositories from an organization where user is a member

      Some plugin outputs may be affected by this setting too.

      Set to `""` to disable and fetch all repositories related to given account.
      Broad affiliations will result in less representative metrics.
    type: array
    format: comma-separated
    default: owner
    values:
      - owner
      - collaborator
      - organization_member
